I'm currently an Applied Research Scientist at Thomson Reuters. 
I obtained my Master of Science in Applied Computing from the University of Toronto. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree with the Computer Science specialist in Artificial Intelligence and the math major from the same university.
