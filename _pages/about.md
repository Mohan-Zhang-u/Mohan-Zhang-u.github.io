I'm currently a tech investor at [Sixty Degree Capital](https://www.omersventures.com/). I invest in technology companies, especially in the field of AI/ML. I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and business, and I love working with entrepreneurs to help them build their companies.
Previously, I was an Applied Research Scientist at Thomson Reuters. 
I obtained my Master of Science in Applied Computing from the University of Toronto. Prior to that, I received my bachelor's degree with the Computer Science specialist in Artificial Intelligence and the math major from the same university.
