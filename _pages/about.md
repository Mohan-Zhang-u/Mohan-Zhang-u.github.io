I'm currently leading the AI Investments at [Sixty Degree Capital](https://www.sixtydegreecapital.com/#portfolio), with a focus on AI infrastructure, developer tools, open-source, and AI applications.

Previously, I was an Applied Research Scientist at Thomson Reuters Labs, working on the training, evaluation, and deployment of language models.

I hold a Master of Science in Applied Computing from the University of Toronto, where I also earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (specialist in Artificial Intelligence) and Mathematics (major).
