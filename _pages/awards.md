### [Learning By Doing – NeurIPS 2021 Competition](https://learningbydoingcompetition.github.io/files/competition_whitepaper.pdf)
*Toronto, 2021* <br/>
We are the 2nd place in both CHEM and ROBO tracks.
They are data-sparse (only a few hundred trajectories!) dynamical system control challenges, including both open-loop and closed-loop control.
We tackled the challenge with feature engineering and hand-crafted neural networks. The 1st place winner solved the problem by reverse-engineering the parameters of differential equations.

### [Vector Research Grant](https://vectorinstitute.ai/)
*Toronto, 2019-2020* <br/>
The Vector Institute is committed to driving excellence and leadership in Canada’s knowledge, creation, and use of artificial intelligence (AI) to foster economic growth and improve the lives of Canadians. Graduate students and postdoctoral fellows supervised by our faculty members, such as yourself, form part of a vibrant community of innovative problem-solvers, working across disciplines on both curiosity-driven and applied research. During your time here, it is anticipated that your scientific research will contribute to the development of knowledge and novel applications in the field of machine learning, as well as artificial intelligence more broadly.
